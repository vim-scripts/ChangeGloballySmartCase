DESCRIPTION				 *ChangeGloballySmartCase-description*

As an add-on to the |ChangeGlobally.vim| plugin (vimscript #4321), this plugin
implements a |gC| variant that uses a "smart case" substitution which covers
variations in upper-/lowercase ("maxSize" vs. "MaxSize") as well as different
coding styles like CamelCase and underscore_notation ("maxSize", "MAX_SIZE").

The |gC| command works just like built-in |c|, and after leaving insert mode
applies the local substitution to all other occurrences (according to the
|SmartCase-rules|) in the current line (in case of a small character change)
or, when entire line(s) where changed, to the rest of the buffer.
This is especially useful for variable renamings and all the other small
tactical edits that you're doing frequently. It is much faster than doing a
single change and repeating it, or building a |:substitute| command,
especially since you would have to repeat that for all text variants that
SmartCase covers.

USAGE					       *ChangeGloballySmartCase-usage*
								   *gC* *v_gC*
[N]["x]gC{motion}	Like |gc|, but also substitute close textual variants
{Visual}[N]["x]gC	of the changed text according to the |SmartCase-rules|:
			- variations in upper-/lowercase
			  ("maxSize" vs. "MaxSize")
			- different coding styles like CamelCase and
			  underscore_notation ("maxSize", "MAX_SIZE")
									 *gCC*
["x]gCC			Like |gcc|, but with |SmartCase-rules|. It's probably
			less useful than |gC|, but added for completeness.

EXAMPLE					     *ChangeGloballySmartCase-example*

Suppose you have a line like this, and you want to rename the type from
"NodeList" to "FooBarSet", and adapt the variable name, too:
    function set nodeList(nodeList:NodeList):void; // Update node list. ~

With the cursor on the start of any of the "nodeList", type gCe, enter the
text "fooBarSet", then press <Esc>. The line will turn into
    function set fooBarSet(fooBarSet:FooBarSet):void; // Update foo bar set. ~
You can now re-apply this substitution to other lines or a visual selection
via |.|
